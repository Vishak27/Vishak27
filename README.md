## 🚀 Featured Projects

### **FinSights — RAG-based Financial Document Intelligence**
- Built an end-to-end RAG system over **15 years of SEC 10-K filings** covering **21 S&P 500 companies**
- Designed a **hybrid retrieval architecture** combining structured KPI pipelines with vector-based search to minimize numerical hallucinations
- Deployed a production-grade system using **AWS (S3, ECS, Bedrock), Docker, CI/CD**, achieving **<$0.02 per query**
- Evaluated retrieval quality using offline pipelines with **0.80+ BERTScore**

### **Single Neuron Selectivity Analysis (Neuroscience)**
- Analyzed **4,880 neural spikes** from the Allen Institute Neuropixels dataset
- Identified significant spatial selectivity with **p-value = 0.00025** and **d-prime = 0.811**
- Built visualizations to characterize receptive fields across **81 spatial positions**

### **Intelligent Legal Clause Analyzer**
- Developed an AI-powered legal assistant achieving **97.87% accuracy** in contract clause classification
- Integrated **Legal-BERT** and **LLM APIs** to identify contractual risks and provide mitigation insights
